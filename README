OMG ITS.... the 100 Bot.

BEWARE - I wrote this when I was first learning Python.  There are some very
unpythonic things lurking in here.  Also, the bot never had the chance to 
get very good, and then the show was canceled so I shelved the code.. 

I wrote this while experimenting with Eclipse and PyDev, which leads to some
very unfortunate issues with the formatting.  

OVERVIEW

In my copious spare time, and as a chance to learn Python, I wrote a TriviaBot 
to play the Xbox Live online game "1 vs. 100 Live." I worked with the OpenCV 
library to train the bot to recognize when a question screen is being displayed, 
read images from a webcam, and used PyTesser and the Tesseract engine to read the
question and potential answers. Questions and answers are fed into a 
Google query and also a database of known questions to come up with a guess. 

This was an enjoyable introduction to Python, even though the bot itself was
not very good at guessing. 

Unfortunately the game was canceled before I could improve the guessing
algorithm.
